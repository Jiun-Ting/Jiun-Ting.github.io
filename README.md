### Course Enrollment System
The system supports course searching, cart function, course rating and recommendation. User could search courses by single or multiple conditions and select them into cart.
Considering the hierarchical structure of courses, users are able to put whole/sub-session of course to cart and drop whole/partial of them. Besides, the course that was taken could be rated, which enables the system to generate recommended list based on their preference.
* React.js

### Multi-threaded MapReduce  [[**Code**]](https://github.com/Jiun-Ting/MapReduce)
	Implemented an efficient MapReduce library with C from scratch to handle mapper/reducer threads.
	Considered memory management to avoid generating redundant key/value pairs and free the space properly.
	Optimized partitioning, sorting algorithm and arranged locks to allow mappers to each put values into different partitions correctly and efficiently under the concurrent data structure.

* C Language

### Fitness Tracker App   [[**Code**]](https://github.com/Jiun-Ting/Jiun-Ting.github.io/tree/main/FitnessTracker)
	Designed an iOS App with react native allowing users to set their calorie goals and to record their daily meal, exercises. In addition, all information is summarized for user to track their daily progress.
	Constructed callback mechanisms and data structures properly to ensure records are efficiently synchronized.
	Tested each function extensively to ensure data to be successfully accessed and modified through RESTful API.
* React Native, RESTful API


### Evaluation of Big Data Systems  [[**Code**]]( https://github.com/Jiun-Ting/CS744-Big-Data-Systems)
1. Distributed Data Parallel Training: Analyzed the performance of different gradient synchronization methods in PyTorch, which includes gather/scatter, all reduce, and the built-in module. 
2.	Apache Spark Deployment and Testing: Deployed Hadoop and Spark on Cloudlab and conducted experiments to observe the result of RDD partitioning, RDD persistence and fault tolerance by implementing Pagerank.
3.	Tuning Databases Towards Reduced Energy Consumption: Observed the relationship between performance and power consumption with different knobs setting in Cassandra and Postgres. Then applied clustering methods to classify our samplings and analyzed the features of each group.

* Python, PyTorch, Spark, Postgres, Cassandra

B+ Tree Index Manager   [[**Code**]](https://github.com/Jiun-Ting/B-TreeIndexManager)
	Constructed a B+ tree with C++ from scratch to manage the index of Badger DB. 
	Implemented index insertion, range scan, next scan in an efficient and correct manner.
	Managed the buffer pool properly which ensures the pages pinned in the buffer pool if necessary.
* C++



### Bank Webpage  [[**link**]](https://jiun-ting.github.io/bank%20webpage/index.html) 
Simple webpage layout design.
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.
