# Projects


### Course Enrollment System [[**Code**]](https://github.com/Jiun-Ting/Jiun-Ting.github.io/tree/main/Course%20Enrollment)
The system supports searching, shopping cart, course rating and recommendation. User could search courses with single or multiple conditions. Considering the hierarchical structure of courses, users are able to put whole/sub-session of course to cart and drop whole/part of them. Besides, the rating function for the taken courses enables the system to generate recommended list based on their preference.
* React.js

### Fitness Tracker App   [[**Code**]](https://github.com/Jiun-Ting/Jiun-Ting.github.io/tree/main/FitnessTracker)
This iOS App allowing users to set their daily calorie goals and to record their daily meal, exercises. In addition, all information is summarized for user to track their daily progress.
* React Native, RESTful API

### Multi-threaded MapReduce Library [[**Code**]](https://github.com/Jiun-Ting/MapReduce)
The library creates mulit-threads to perform the map/reduce tasks with efficient concurrency support by taking user-defined Map/Reduce function and the assigned number of thread for mappper and reducer.
* C Language

### Evaluation of Big Data Systems  [[**Code**]](https://github.com/Jiun-Ting/CS744-Big-Data-Systems)
1. Distributed Data Parallel Training: Analyzed the performance of different gradient synchronization methods in PyTorch, which includes gather/scatter, all reduce, and the built-in module. 
2. Apache Spark Deployment and Testing: Deployed Hadoop and Spark on Cloudlab and conducted experiments to observe the result of RDD partitioning, RDD persistence and fault tolerance by implementing Pagerank.
3. Tuning Databases Towards Reduced Energy Consumption: Observed the relationship between performance and power consumption with different knobs setting in Cassandra and Postgres. Then applied clustering methods to classify our samplings and analyzed the features of each group.

* Python, PyTorch, Spark, Postgres, Cassandra

### B+ Tree Index Manager   [[**Code**]](https://github.com/Jiun-Ting/B-TreeIndexManager)
	Constructed a B+ tree with C++ from scratch to manage the index of Badger DB. 
	Implemented index insertion, range scan, next scan in an efficient and correct manner.
	Managed the buffer pool properly which ensures the pages pinned in the buffer pool if necessary.
* C++

### Monetary Policy Analysis  [[**Graphs**]](https://github.com/Jiun-Ting/Master_Thesis)
 Constructed a Time-Varying Parameter Vector Autoregressive model and simulated with MCMC/Gibbs sampling approach with MATLAB to capture the monetary effect under different interest rate environment.
 Demonstrated the effect of policy shocks in different periods with 3D visualizations.
* MATLAB

### NBA Team Member Selection  [[**Code**]](https://github.com/Jiun-Ting/NBA-Fantacy-Team-Member-Selection)
The project applied supervised learning and integer optimization with actual data to simulate an optimal NBA team.
* Julia

### Visualization of Amazon Product Categories  [[**Example-Electronics**]](https://jiun-ting.github.io/Tree%20Visualization/Electronics.html) [[**Example-Music**]](https://jiun-ting.github.io/Tree%20Visualization/music.html)[[**Code**]](https://github.com/Jiun-Ting/Tree-Visualization-Amazon-Product-Categories)
This interactive visualization aims at helping us to understand if a main category is skewed, where the products concentrate in certain subgroups; Or if some categories have an extreme long path. Once we find out such case with the graph, we could evaluate the existing category design in a clear fashion and gain more insignt to improve. The node size stands for their product amount (products of their subcategories are not included), while the colors stand for tree levels.
* Python

### Bank Webpage  [[**link**]](https://jiun-ting.github.io/bank%20webpage/index.html) 
Simple webpage layout design.
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap.
